 CS50 final Project.
 full CRUD Functionality


 I Created An EVENT Planner application.
  The code for this app returns HTML files based on the user request.
  It uses  flask, a framework written in Python, it allow me to skip over having to implement basic features.

  The CS50 IDE has the flask package pre-installed with variables and functions defined in the flask package’s code.
  In the CS50 IDE, the user can simply type flask run in the command-line and enter.
  It will look for application.py and run it, in doing so the user can visit the application routes
  by clinking the link in the IDE and see the page I created.

  After loading the page by running flask run,
  you must register for an account and see the events that will load on my website’s index page.
  After registering, you can search for events in your area, add events to our master database (written in SQL),
  sign up for events that were registered by others, search for new events, and even look up events in Google.
